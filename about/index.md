## Short Bio:

I'm currently a first-year master student at Peking University, affiliated to [KLCL](http://klcl.pku.edu.cn/) and advised by [Prof. Li Sujian](http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/member/lisujian/maincontent.htm). Prior to PKU, I got B.S. in Computer Science from  [IEEE Honor Class](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I found my life goals, best friends and beloved girlfriend. 

My research interests are **natural language processing** and **machine learning**, with current special focus on **discourse analysis** and **machine reading comprehension**.

You can find more details in my [resume](/resume.pdf) and [blog](/).
